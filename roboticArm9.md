# Zorder
I've been thinking this morning and zorder is the one that saves the most time. It's very easy to develop and demonstrates that the forward mode is superior to backpropagation when changing the operation graph for each frame, which is unfeasible from a practical standpoint because the others require "compilation" time.

From a mathematical point of view, you only have to find the intersection point between two segments. That intersection point is what exerts a force in the direction of the line of sight.

## Python code for intersection of two segments given two endpoints in a 2D space.

```python
import math

def intersect_segments_2d(P1, P2, Q1, Q2, tol=1e-9):
    """
    Find the intersection of two line segments in 2D.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    P1, P2 : (float, float)
        Endpoints of the first segment.
    Q1, Q2 : (float, float)
        Endpoints of the second segment.
    tol : float
        Tolerance for floating-point comparisons.
    
    Returns
    -------
    None
        If there is no intersection.
    (x, y)
        If the segments intersect at exactly one point.
    ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))
        If the segments are collinear and overlap in a segment;
        returns the two extreme endpoints of that overlapping segment.

One of the challenges in parallel computation is instructions like:

```python
if abs(cross_uv) > tol:
```

That is, since parallel processing is done for all individuals in the population, it is difficult to execute a conditional instruction.

These are for cases where one of the endpoints is on the segment. Do these cases occur? Can we dispense with this check?
